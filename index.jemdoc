== About me
I received the B.S. degree in automation (Supervisor: Professor [http://wulwxy.hhuc.edu.cn/2010/0527/c1491a27544/page.htm Yuncan Xue]) from College of Internet of Things (IOT) Engineering, [http://www.hhu.edu.cn/ Hohai University (HHU)],
the M.S. degree in mathematics (Supervisor: Associate Professor [http://jszy.hhu.edu.cn/yjb/ Jianbin Yang]) from College of Science, [http://www.hhu.edu.cn/ Hohai University (HHU)], and the Ph.D. degree in mechatronic engineering
(Supervisor: Professors [https://web.njit.edu/~zhou/ Mengchu Zhou] and [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhiwu_Li Zhiwu Li]) from School of Mechano-Electronic Engineering, [https://www.xidian.edu.cn/index.htm Xidian University (XDU)] in 2014, 2017, and 2021, respectively.
I was a Visiting Ph.D. Student (Co-advisor: Professor [http://www.ece.ualberta.ca/~pedrycz/ Witold Pedrycz]) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.
I was also a Research Assistant (Co-advisor: Assistant Professor [https://junzhaogroupntu.github.io/ Jun Zhao]) at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.
I was also a Visiting Ph.D. Student (Co-advisor: Professor [https://robotics.nus.edu.sg/sge/ Shuzhi Sam Ge]) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore.
I am currently a postdoctor under the supervision of Professor [http://iopen.nwpu.edu.cn/info/1015/1172.htm Xuelong li]. My research interests include fuzzy theory, wavelet analysis, pattern recognition, granular computing, image processing, and computer vision. I am a member of China Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (CSIAM).
