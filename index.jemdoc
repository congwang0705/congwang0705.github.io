== About me
I received the B.S. degree in automation (Supervisor: Professor [http://wulwxy.hhuc.edu.cn/2010/0527/c1491a27544/page.htm Yuncan Xue]) from College of Internet of Things (IOT) Engineering, [http://www.hhu.edu.cn/ Hohai University (HHU)],
the M.S. degree in mathematics (Supervisor: Professor [http://jszy.hhu.edu.cn/yjb/ Jianbin Yang]) from College of Science, [http://www.hhu.edu.cn/ Hohai University (HHU)], and the Ph.D. degree in mechatronic engineering
(Supervisor: Professors [https://web.njit.edu/~zhou/ Mengchu Zhou] and [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhiwu_Li Zhiwu Li]) from School of Mechano-Electronic Engineering, [https://www.xidian.edu.cn/index.htm Xidian University (XDU)] in 2014, 2017, and 2021, respectively.
I was a Visiting Ph.D. Student (Co-advisor: Professor [http://www.ece.ualberta.ca/~pedrycz/ Witold Pedrycz]) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.
I was also a Research Assistant (Co-advisor: Assistant Professor [https://junzhaogroupntu.github.io/ Jun Zhao]) at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.
I was also a Visiting Ph.D. Student (Co-advisor: Professor [https://robotics.nus.edu.sg/sge/ Shuzhi Sam Ge]) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore.
I am currently an associate professor and also a postdoctoral fellow under the supervision of Professor [http://iopen.nwpu.edu.cn/info/1015/1172.htm Xuelong Li]. My research interests include information computation, G-image processing, fuzzy theory, as well as wavelet analysis and its applications. I am a member of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Chinese Institute of Electronics (CIE), China Computer Federation (CCF), China Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (CSIAM), and China Society of Image and Graphics (CSIG).
